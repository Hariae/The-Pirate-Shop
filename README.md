# The-Pirate-Shop

The application is developed as part of a challenge.

A basic web application to emulate adding products to a shopping cart. The application is built on React JS. 

Steps to run the application
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to application folder "thepirateshop"
3. Enter the command "npm install". This step is to install all dependencies
4. Once the installation is complete, enter the command "npm start".
5. The application by default runs on port 3000

Note: React works on state which is not persistent, on page refresh the state is reset and the application returns to initial state.

Enjoy the application!
